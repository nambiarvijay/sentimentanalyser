Sentiment analysis of tweets using python

In this project, we are attempting to create a system capable of classifying a
given text as having positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis also
known as opinion mining involves using text processing, natural language processing
and computational linguistics to extract relevant information about
the subject under consideration.(Wikipedia defn.)
Twitter is a popular micro blogging service where users create status
messages called tweets.Tweets are short messages with a maximum length
of 140 characters. Authors of those messages write about their lives , share
opinions on a variety of topics and discuss current issues. As more and
more users post about the products and services they use, or express their
political and religious views, micro blogging websites become valuable sources
of peoples opinions and sentiments.
